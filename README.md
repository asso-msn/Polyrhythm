# Make Some Noise's website

Make Some Noise is a French organization promoting the arcade rhythm games genre.  
We mostly operate in Paris region by organizing free meet-ups where people can come
and enjoy our setups on dedicated controllers, or by being invited at conventions,
mostly anime-related one, where we also let people enjoy our setups for free.

With this website, we also want to help broadcasting information about the games and
the community to a wider audience, but also promoting our organization efficiently.
